`bevy_behave` is a behaviour tree plugin for bevy with a sensible API and minimal overheads.
No magic is required for the task components, they are are regular bevy components using triggers to report status.

When an action (aka leaf node, task node) in the behaviour tree runs, it will spawn an entity with
the components you specified in the tree definition. The tree then waits for this entity to
trigger a status report, at which point the entity will be despawned.

You can also take actions without spawning an entity by triggering an Event, which can also be used as a conditional in a control node.



This tree definition is from the [chase example](https://github.com/RJ/bevy_behave/blob/main/examples/chase.rs):

```rust,ignore
let npc_entity = get_enemy_entity();
let player_entity = get_player_entity();

// The tree definition (which is cloneable).
// and in theory, able to be loaded from an asset file using reflection (PRs welcome).
// When added to the BehaveTree component, this gets transformed internally to hold state etc.
//
// These trees are `ego_tree::Tree<Behave>` if you want to construct them manually.
// Conventient macro usage shown below.
let tree = behave! {
    Behave::Forever => {
        Behave::Sequence => {
            Behave::dynamic_spawn((
                Name::new("Wait until player is near"),
                WaitUntilPlayerIsNear{player: *player}
            )),
            Behave::Sequence => {
                Behave::dynamic_spawn((
                    Name::new("Move towards player while in range"),
                    MoveTowardsPlayer{player: *player, speed: ENEMY_SPEED}
                )),
                // MoveTowardsPlayer suceeds if we catch them, in which randomize our colour.
                // This uses a trigger to take an action without spawning an entity.
                Behave::trigger_req(RandomizeColour),
                // then have a nap (pause execution of the tree)
                // NB: this only runs if the trigger_req was successful, since it's in a Sequence.
                Behave::Wait(5.0),
            }
        }
    }
};
```

```rust,ignore
// Breaking a tree into two trees and composing, just to show how it's done.
let chase_subtree = behave! {
    Behave::Sequence => {
        Behave::dynamic_spawn((
            Name::new("Move towards player while in range"),
            MoveTowardsPlayer{player_entity, speed: 100.0}
        )),
        // MoveTowardsPlayer suceeds if we catch them, in which randomize our colour.
        // This uses a trigger to take an action without spawning an entity.
        Behave::trigger_req(RandomizeColour),
        // then have a nap (pause execution of the tree)
        // NB: this only runs if the trigger_req was successful, since it's in a Sequence.
        Behave::Wait(5.0),
    }
};

let tree = behave! {
    Behave::Forever => {
        // Run children in sequence until one fails
        Behave::Sequence => {
            // WAIT FOR THE PLAYER TO GET CLOSE
            // Spawn with any normal components that will control the target entity:
            Behave::dynamic_spawn((
                Name::new("Wait until player is near"),
                WaitUntilPlayerIsNear{player_entity}
            )),
            // CHASE THE PLAYER
            @ chase_subtree
        }
    }
};
```

Once you have your tree definition, you spawn an entity to run the behaviour tree by adding a `BehaveTree` component:

```rust,ignore
// Spawn an entity to run the behaviour tree.
// Make it a child of the npc entity for convenience.
// The default is to assume the Parent of the tree entity is the Target Entity you're controlling.
commands.spawn((
    Name::new("Behave tree for NPC"),
    BehaveTree::new(tree)
)).set_parent(npc_entity);
```

## Control Flow Nodes

The following control flow nodes are supported. Control flow logic is part of the `BehaveTree` and doesn't spawn extra entities.

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Behave::Sequence` | Runs children in sequence, failing if any child fails, succeeding if all children succeed. |
| `Behave::Fallback` | Runs children in sequence until one succeeds. If all fail, this fails. Sometimes called a Selector node. |
| `Behave::Invert` | Inverts success/failure of child. Must only have one child. |
| `Behave::AlwaysSucceed` | Succeeds instantly. |
| `Behave::AlwaysFail` | Fails instantly. |

## Task Nodes

Task nodes are leaves of the tree which take some action, typically doing something to control your target entity, such as making it move.

#### Behave::Wait

Waits a given duration before Succeeding. The timer is ticked by the tree itself, so no entities are spawned.

#### Behave::dynamic_spawn(...)

When a `Behave::dynamic_spawn` node runs, a new entity is spawned with the components you provided along with a
`BehaveCtx` component, which will tell you the target entity the tree is controlling, and a
mechanism to trigger a status report for success or failure.

Once a result is reported, the entity is despawned.

#### Behave::trigger_req(...)

When a `Behave::trigger_req` node runs, it will trigger an event, which the user observes and can either respond to with a success or failure immediately, or respond later from another system.

If you respond with a success or failure from the observer you can treat the event as a conditional test as part of a control flow node. Alternatively, you can use it to trigger a side effect and respond later from another system. Just make sure to copy the `BehaveCtx` so you can generate a success or failure event at your leisure.



> Have a look at the [chase example](https://github.com/RJ/bevy_behave/blob/main/examples/chase.rs) to see how these are used.


### Utility components

For your convenience:

#### Triggering completion after a timeout

To trigger a status report on a dynamic spawn task after a timeout, use the `BehaveTimeout` helper component:

```rust,ignore
let tree = behave! {
    Behave::dynamic_spawn((
        Name::new("Long running task that succeeds after 5 seconds"),
        LongRunningTaskComp::new(),
        BehaveTimeout::from_secs(5.0, true)
    ))
}
```

This will get the `BehaveCtx` from the entity, and trigger a success or failure report for you after the timeout.


## How conditionals/non-spawning tasks work

You specify an arbitrary struct which is 
delivered in a generic trigger which also carries a `BehaveCtx` value.
The observer can then respond with success or failure.


Here's how you might combine a Sequence with a trigger_req conditional to execute a specific task if a height condition is met:
```rust,ignore
let tree = behave! {
    Behave::Sequence => {
        Behave::trigger_req(HeightCheck { min_height: 10.0 }),
        Behave::dynamic_spawn((
            Name::new("Doing the thing because we are high enough"),
            DoSomethingIfHigh::default(),
        )),
    }
}
```

And the implementation:

```rust,ignore
// TriggerReq payloads just need to be Clone.
// They are wrapped in a BehaveTrigger, which is a bevy Event.
#[derive(Clone)]
struct HeightCheck {
    min_height: f32,
}

// add a global observer to answer conditional queries for HeightCheck:
app.add_observer(on_height_check);

// you respond by triggering a success or failure event created by the ctx:
fn on_height_check(trigger: Trigger<BehaveTrigger<HeightCheck>>, q: Query<&Position>, mut commands: Commands) {
    let ctx: BehaveCtx = trigger.event().ctx();
    let height_check: HeightCheck = trigger.event().value();
    // lookup the position of the target entity (ie the entity this behaviour tree is controlling)
    let character_pos = q.get(ctx.target_entity()).expect("Character entity missing?");
    if character_pos.y >= height_check.min_height {
        commands.trigger(ctx.success());
    } else {
        commands.trigger(ctx.failure());
    }
}

```

It's also possible to use a trigger_req, and send the `BehaveCtx` to another system and respond later, if you're doing something with existing entities.

## Performance

is good.

* There's just one global observer for receiving task status reports from entities or triggers.
* Most of the time, the work is being done in a spawned entity using one of your action components,
and in this state, there is a marker on the tree entity so it doesn't tick or do anything until
a result is ready.
* Avoided mut World systems â€“ the tree ticking should be able to run in parallel with other things.
* So a fairly minimal wrapper around basic bevy systems.

In release mode, i can happily toss 100k enemies in the chase demo and zoom around at max framerate.
It gets slow rendering a zillion gizmo circles before any bevy_behave stuff gets in the way.

**Chase example**

This is the chase example from this repo, running in release mode on an M1 mac with 100k enemies.
Each enemy has a behaviour tree child and an active task component entity. So 1 enemy is 3 entities.

**Video from my space game**

Here I have more complex behaviour trees managing orbits, landing, etc. Lots of PID controllers at work.
No attempts at optimising the logic yet, but I can add 5k ships running behaviours. Each is a dynamic avian physics object exerting forces via a thruster.

## Notes

The `behave!` macro is an extension of the `ego_tree::tree!` macro.
I have upstreamed my change to ego_tree, but it is not released to crates yet.

#### TODO

* validate tree shape. some nodes need a specific number of children.
* tests for control flow logic

#### Paths not taken

<details>

<summary>Alternative approach taking `IntoSystem` (not taken)</summary>

### Alternative approach for conditionals

I considered doing control flow by taking an `IntoSystem` with a defined In and Out type,
something like this:
```rust,ignore

pub type BoxedConditionSystem = Box<dyn System<In = In<BehaveCtx>, Out = bool>>;

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Behave {
    // ...
    /// If, then
    Conditional(BoxedConditionSystem),
}

impl Behave {
    pub fn conditional<Marker>(system: impl IntoSystem<In<BehaveCtx>, bool, Marker>) -> Behave {
        Behave::Conditional(Box::new(IntoSystem::into_system(system)))
    }
}
```

Then you could defined a cond system like, which is quite convenient:

```rust,ignore
fn check_distance(In(ctx): In<BehaveCtx>, q: Query<&Position, With<Player>>) -> bool {
    let Ok(player_pos) = q.get(ctx.target_entity).unwrap();
    player_pos.x < 100.0
}
```


However I don't think the resulting data struct would be cloneable, nor could you really read
it from an asset file for manipulation (or can you?)

I would also need mutable World in the "tick trees" system, which would stop it running in parallel maybe.
Anyway observers seem to work pretty well.
