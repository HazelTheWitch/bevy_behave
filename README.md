# bevy_behave

A behaviour tree plugin for bevy with dynamic spawning.

When an action (leaf node / task node) in the behaviour tree runs, it will spawn an entity with
the components you specified in the tree definition. The tree then waits for this entity to
trigger a status report, at which point the entity will be despawned.

Conditionals are implemented with observers, see below.

This was an experiment to see if I could make an ergonomic bevyish way to do behaviour trees,
I think it's turning out fairly well. Please do offer feedback (good or bad) if you check it out!


```rust
let npc_entity = get_enemy_entity();
let player_entity = get_player_entity();

// the tree definition (which is cloneable).
// and in theory, able to be loaded from an asset file (unimplemented).
// when added to the BehaveTree component, this gets transformed internally to hold state etc.
let tree = tree! {
    Behave::Forever => {
        // Run children in sequence until one fails
        Behave::Sequence => {
            // Spawn with any normal components that will control the target entity:
            Behave::dynamic_spawn((
                Name::new("Wait until player is near"),
                WaitUntilPlayerIsNear{player_entity}
            )),
            Behave::Sequence => {
                Behave::dynamic_spawn((
                    Name::new("Move towards player while in range"),
                    MoveTowardsPlayer{player_entity, speed: 100.0}
                )),
                // MoveTowardsPlayer suceeds if we catch them, in which randomize our colour.
                // This uses a trigger to take an action without spawning an entity.
                Behave::trigger_req(RandomizeColour),
                // then have a nap (pause execution of the tree)
                // NB: this only runs if the trigger_req was successful, since it's in a Sequence.
                Behave::Wait(5.0),
            }
        }
    }
};

// Spawn an entity to run the behaviour tree.
// Make it a child of the npc entity for convenience.
// The default is to assume the Parent of the tree entity is the Target Entity you're controlling.
commands.spawn((
    Name::new("Behave tree for NPC"),
    BehaveTree::new(tree)
)).set_parent(npc_entity);
```

When a dynamic spawn happens, the entity is given the components you provided along with a
`BehaveCtx` component, which will tell you the target entity the tree is controlling, and a
mechanism to trigger a status report for success or failure.

Have a look at the [chase example](https://github.com/RJ/bevy_behave/blob/main/examples/chase.rs).


### Control Flow Nodes

Currently supported control flow nodes:

| Node          | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sequence      | Runs children in sequence, failing if any fails, succeeding if all succeed                  |
| Fallback      | Runs children in sequence until one succeeds. If all fail, this fails                       |
| Invert        | Inverts success/failure of child. Must only have one child                                  |
| AlwaysSucceed | Always succeeds                                                                             |
| AlwaysFail    | Always fails                                                                                |
| TriggerReq    | Triggers an event, which the user observes and responds to with a success or failure report |

### Task Nodes

| Node         | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Wait         | Waits this many seconds before Succeeding<br>Timer is ticked inside the tree, no entities are spawned.                                                                         |
| DynamicSpawn | Spawns an entity when this node in the tree is reached, and waits for it to trigger a status report.<br>Once the entity triggers a status report, it is immediately despawned. |

### Unimplemented but possibly useful Task Nodes:

| Node           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ExistingEntity | When this node on the tree is reached, a `BehaveCtx` is inserted.<br>The tree then waits for this entity to trigger a status report.<br>On completion, `BehaveCtx` is removed, but nothing is despawned. |


## How conditionals/non-spawning tasks work

I'm using observer events to implement no-entity-required tasks. You specify an arbitrary struct which is 
delivered in a generic trigger which also carries a `BehaveCtx` value.
The observer can then respond with success or failure.


```rust
// Conditionals are types that are delivered by a trigger:
#[derive(Clone)]
struct HeightCheck {
    min_height: f32,
}

// add a global observer to answer conditional queries for HeightCheck:
app.add_observer(on_height_check);

// you respond by triggering a success or failure event created by the ctx:
fn on_height_check(trigger: Trigger<BehaveTrigger<HeightCheck>>, q: Query<&Position>, mut commands: Commands) {
    let ctx: BehaveTriggerCtx = trigger.event().ctx();
    let height_check: HeightCheck = trigger.event().value();
    // lookup the position of the target entity (ie the entity this behaviour tree is controlling)
    let character_pos = q.get(ctx.target_entity()).expect("Character entity missing?");
    if character_pos.y >= height_check.min_height {
        commands.trigger(ctx.success());
    } else {
        commands.trigger(ctx.failure());
    }
}

```

## Performance

* There's just one global observer for receiving task status reports from entities or triggers.
* Most of the time, the work is being done in a spawned entity using one of your action components,
and in this state, there is a marker on the tree component so it doesn't tick or do anything until
a result is ready.
* Avoided mut World systems â€“ the tree ticking should be able to run in parallel with other things (i think).
* So a fairly minimal wrapper around basic bevy systems.

In release mode i can happily toss 100k enemies in the chase demo and zoom around at max framerate.
It gets slow rendering a zillion gizmo circles before any bevy_behave stuff gets in the way.

## Notes

<summary>Alternative approach taking `IntoSystem` (not taken)</summary>

### Alternative approach for conditionals

I considered doing control flow by taking an `IntoSystem` with a defined In and Out type,
something like this:
```rust

pub type BoxedConditionSystem = Box<dyn System<In = In<BehaveCtx>, Out = bool>>;

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Behave {
    // ...
    /// If, then
    Conditional(BoxedConditionSystem),
}

impl Behave {
    pub fn conditional<Marker>(system: impl IntoSystem<In<BehaveCtx>, bool, Marker>) -> Behave {
        Behave::Conditional(Box::new(IntoSystem::into_system(system)))
    }
}
```

Then you could defined a cond system like, which is quite convenient:

```rust
fn check_distance(In(ctx): In<BehaveCtx>, q: Query<&Position, With<Player>>) -> bool {
    let Ok(player_pos) = q.get(ctx.target_entity).unwrap();
    player_pos.x < 100.0
}
```


However I don't think the resulting data struct would be cloneable, nor could you really read
it from an asset file for manipulation (or can you?)

I would also need mutable World in the "tick trees" system, which would stop it running in parallel maybe.
Anyway observers seem to work pretty well.
